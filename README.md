👋 Hi there! I'm Cindy, a recent college graduate with a strong passion for technology, learning, and creativity. Welcome to my corner of GitHub!

🎓 Here, I showcase my projects and experiments in coding, reflecting the skills and knowledge I've gained through my academic journey. As I embark on my professional career, I'm excited to explore innovative solutions and contribute to the tech world.

🕹️ When I'm not coding, you can find me diving into the world of gaming or immersing myself in the vibrant universes of my favorite animations. These hobbies not only fuel my imagination but also inspire me to think outside the box when tackling tech projects.

🚀 As a lifelong learner, I'm eager to discover new technologies and expand my skill set. I love collaborating with others, so if you have any ideas or want to work together on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out!

📫 If you'd like to get in touch or learn more about me, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chengcindyy) or send me an email at chengcindyy@gmail.com. I'm always happy to chat and make new connections!

Happy coding! 😄
